# 42Cursus
This repository will contain most of the projects from my experience at the Cursus. Every project will have a README with its corresponding score.

If you're a student at **any** 42 school, please refrain from copying anything you don't fully understand. You'll just hurt your learning experience and probably end up with a bad score in the project.

Having said that, most .h files will contain a description of what each function does, including parameters and return values.

Subjects will not be provided within this repo, as they might change. Trust me, you're better off reading the official subject from the intra. I had one changed while I was working in a project and it wasn't fun.
