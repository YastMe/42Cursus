## GET_NEXT_LINE

**Score: 125/100**

In this project, the student is tasked with writting a function that allows them to read a single line from a file descriptor.
The remaining text after the \n character should be stored in a static variable for it not to be lost in further uses of the function.

The main challenge in this project was learning how static variables worked and how they stay in memory.
Other than that, if you understand the basic flow of the code and what each function does, it should be smooth sailing.
