## PRINTF

**WARNING: This project does not contain the bonus part. If you're considering doing it, structure your code accordingly from the beginning.**

**Score: 100/100**

This is just the printf function from the stdio.h library, but trimmed to include just the relevant parts.
It's not really a hard project, albeit a slightly tedious one.

The main challenge in this project was understanding how variable arguments work. Look it up and you should be good to go! The rest of the project is mainly parsing everything to have the correct format.
