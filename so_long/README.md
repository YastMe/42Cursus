## SO_LONG

**Score: 125/100**

so_long is a project in which the student is tasked to create a small game. The subject proposes a theme but immediately afterwards says that the given theme can be completely ignored. And so I did.

The main challenge behind this project was memory management and library documentation research. If you're reading this and thinking about tackling this project, please ask your Campus' Staff if MLX42 is allowed instead of minilibx. I used MLX42 because is infinitely easier and has **some** documentation.

Good luck!
